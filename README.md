### ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Corkboard is a full-stack native iOS app built in Swift and a combo of Firestore & Node with PostgreSQL on the server side. Corkboard allows users to share media and information from their phone directly with their friends and family on easy-to-use boards. Users can invite other users to collaborate on boards together, as well as have individually used boards. Items that can be added to a board currently include notes, images & videos from a phone or taken live, website thumbnail links and thumbnail maps that open directions in google maps app (more items coming soon, keep checking back!).
